# DevOps Fundamentals: Breaking Down the Culture, Tools, and Practices

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture that improves organizational ability to **deliver** the the application.

Let me give you an example: Imagine there's an issue on [shubhams.dev](https://shubhams.dev). Once the development team fixes the issue, the DevOps practices ensure that the changes can be deployed quickly and reliably to production.

Usually people think, **DevOps <--> CI/CD**(improving delivery). Infact **DevOps** is **Improving Delivery**, but it consists of many different things.

> **DevOps** is a process of **improving application** delivery by ensuring there is proper automation in place, quality maintaining, continous monitoring an continous testing.

## Why DevOps?

So, many years ago when DevOps was not there then the process was much tidious, explain belowüëá

System Admins -> They used to create severs

Developer -> They put the code to some central location(Servers / VM ware)

Tester -> They used to test the application which is present on the server

BRE(Build and Release Engineer) -> They take forward to production or pre-production

This process was taking too much time because of different teams. So, After DevOps this process became fast and smooth

## How to introduce yourself?
